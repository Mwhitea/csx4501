***_Assignment 02 - make a Python notebook to analyze CORGIS data_***

*Step 1*:  Get another dataset of interest to you (besides Classics) from The Collection of Really Great, Interesting, Situated Datasets (Links to an external site.)

You may choose either the Python, CSV, or JSON data
Download the dataset to your computer
Pay attention to the "Usage" note if necessary
*Step 2*: Clone your "csx4501" repository to your computer (if you have not done so already)

*Step 3*: Start Jupyter and navigate into your cloned folder using the Jupyter file browser

*Step 4*: Move your downloaded data files into the same cloned folder

*Step 5*: Create a new Python notebook

Rename the notebook appropriately
Add markdown cells to document your new analysis (title, your name, a link to the dataset, basic description of the data, etc.)

*Step 6*: Write Python code to explore the dataset

The analysis need not be extremely lengthy, but it should contain at least one of each of the following:
commands to read the datafile
mathematical operation
conditional expression
for loop
function (both a new function definition and an execution of that function)
module import and use of the module somewhere in the code
Even though you are exploring the data, make it a cohesive whole, with plenty of code comments and markdown cells to document what you are doing and what you are finding

*Step 7*: Push your new files to your GitHub repository

You will need to Add, Commit, and Push your newly added/modified files
If the push command prompts you for authentication, you may also need to generate a personal access token for the password
If you don't have one, follow the steps at GitHub's documentation page for creating a personal access token (Links to an external site.)
You only get to see the token once, so make sure to store it somewhere securely
After you push successfully, verify that your files are in your GitHub repository online by visiting the website for your repository

*Step 8*: Submit the URL for your repository to confirm that you are done
